## What is OriginTrail?

OriginTrail links together two powerful technologies — blockchains, most widely known to underpin cryptocurrencies, and knowledge graphs, the intelligent data management component driving data platforms like Google, Amazon and Facebook. After launching in early 2019, the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph supported by an open network of over 2000 nodes hosted by both individuals and businesses globally, has seen its initial use in enabling discoverability and verifiability of real world assets in web 3.

## The Knowledge Economy

OriginTrail core developers, we believe that technology should advance human systems towards a sustainable, equitable, and fair future through the power of shared knowledge. We build human-centric, trust-enhancing technology to unlock the potential of ever-growing data for the common good.

## The “Uber” of data

Very similar to how Uber revolutionized the ride sharing industry, the OriginTrial Knowledge Economy will allow its users the ability to revolutionize data sharing. In the same way Uber allows for individuals to generate wealth by utilizing the power of their unused cars all over the globe, the OriginTrail Knowledge Economy will allow for humans to generate wealth as a result of the data footprint they produce daily.
