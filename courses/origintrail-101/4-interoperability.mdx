## What are GS1 Standards?

GS1 standards create a common foundation for business by uniquely identifying, accurately capturing and automatically sharing vital information about products, locations, assets and more. GS1 barcodes/GTINs are necessary for most online and traditional retailers including Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Google, Carrefour, Tesco and Walmart. GS1 barcodes are scanned over 6 billion times each day, driving commerce around the globe. GS1 is the only official provider of GS1 GTINs and EAN/UPC barcodes globally. 

## TraceLabs + GS1

Trace Labs has been one of the pioneers in applying the GS1 EPCIS standard for product visibility. This standard helps to answer the questions “What?” “When?” “Where?” and “Why?” to meet consumer and regulatory demands for accurate and detailed product information. Utilizing the GS1 EPCIS standard, we delivered interoperable data exchange amongst disparate applications. By using the OriginTrail Decentralized Network, we protect data, ensuring the highest levels of trust enabled by a public blockchain.

Our contribution to the GS1 position paper shows the importance of global standards for maintaining the global language of business and facilitating interoperability for blockchain-enabled solutions. The report titled “Bridging Blockchains: Interoperability is essential to the future of data sharing” describes the interplay between blockchain technology, the rise of industry ecosystems, and challenges in bringing the industry together to begin the dialogue around governance, interoperability, and future solutions.

## GS1 Standards aren’t the only ones

The OriginTrail supports a multitude of data standards and continues to absorb the most relevant data standards of our time. This includes the famous “WoT” or Web of Things standard which facilitates the data sharing of millions of IoT devices around the world. This is why it is important to understand that OriginTrail services significantly more than just supply chain data. The OriginTrail protocol is relevant in any industry where data is generated & where adding discoverability and verifiability to such datasets brings benefit.
