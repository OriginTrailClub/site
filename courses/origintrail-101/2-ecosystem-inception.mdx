## Three Branches

OriginTrail is not a company. It is an ecosystem in which everyone can contribute. TraceLabs is a for-profit business building real-world applications on top of the protocol, and are the core developer of the protocol. They are also a founding member of the TraceAlliance which unites companies building or utilizing blockchain solutions.

### The OriginTrail Protocol & Open Community

OriginTrail links together two powerful technologies — blockchains, most widely known to underpin cryptocurrencies, and knowledge graphs, the intelligent data management component driving data platforms like Google, Amazon and Facebook. After launching in early 2019, the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph supported by an open network of over 2000 nodes hosted by both individuals and businesses globally, has seen its initial use in enabling discoverability and verifiability of real world assets in supply chains. - [https://origintrail.io/](https://origintrail.io/)

### The TraceAlliance

The Trace Alliance is a collaboration partnership hub connecting businesses, startups, academics, business leaders and technology vendors with supply chain subject matter experts. The collaborative effort of the alliance resolves different organisational challenges in supply chains management. The Trace Alliance was formed to establish common ground for the prompt and effective utilisation of blockchain up to its full potential. Support from different industry leaders is key for optimal platform development. The Trace Alliance allows companies to receive early access to developing technologies, facilitating new application deployment centered around the OriginTrail protocol. - [https://alliance.origintrail.io/](https://alliance.origintrail.io/)

### Trace Labs

Trace Labs is a blockchain company developing enterprise solutions for trusted data exchange across the supply chain. Their solutions enable forward-thinking organizations to gain the most knowledge possible and make better decisions based on interconnected data from their supply chains. Trace Labs is also the core development company of the open-source OriginTrail protocol for blockchain-based data exchange. Founded in 2013, Trace Labs has built award-winning enterprise solutions for supply chains, including those for traceability and verifiable claims. In 2017, Trace Labs received an award from the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center.

## Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODINE)

OriginTrail was one of nine winners of the Open Data Incubator for Europe (ODINE) in their eighth open call. As food origin is becoming more important, especially in the light of food scandals that are lowering consumer confidence, OriginTrail empowers food brands that hold their promise of provenance and are proud of the origin of their products by enabling them to communicate the food’s origin effectively to the consumers. ODINE supports innovative startups and SMEs by awarding them up to €100,000 each to develop open data solutions for the benefit of industry and the public. The ODINE project is delivered by a consortium of seven partners, coordinated by the University of Southampton and supported by The Guardian as the media partner, who also featured OriginTrail in their [article](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-wins-the-support-of-odine-5f19a0c89af4).
