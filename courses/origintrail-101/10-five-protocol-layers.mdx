There are five distinct layers of the OriginTrail Technology Stack which synergistically creates the OriginTrail Knowledge Economy.

## Application layer

Encompassing both Dapps and traditional applications which utilize the OriginTrail DKG as part of their data flows.

## Service layer

Implementing various core & extended services, such as authentication, standard interfaces and data pipelines.

## Data layer

Hosting the knowledge graph data, distributed across the network in separate instances of graph databases, supporting linked data and industry specific standards (such as supply chain oriented GS1 or W3C semantic standards).

## Network layer

Formed by a peer-to-peer swarm of DKG nodes hosted by individuals and organizations, implemented on a Kademlia DHT.

## Consensus layer

Implementing interfaces to several blockchains hosting OriginTrail smart contracts, used to manage relations between the nodes and implement trustless protocols. OriginTrail currently supports Ethereum, Gnosis Chain and Polygon and is designed & intended to connect to many more chains.
