Within this lesson you will learn the purpose and challenges OriginTrail faces within the in supply chain sector. While we use supply chains as the base example for this course, it is important to understand that the OriginTrail technology stack can be applied to any industry where data is generated.

## What is OriginTrail

OriginTrail links together two powerful technologies — blockchains, most widely known to underpin cryptocurrencies, and knowledge graphs, the intelligent data management component driving data platforms like Google, Amazon and Facebook. After launching in early 2019, the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph supported by an open network of over 2000 nodes hosted by both individuals and businesses globally, has seen its initial use in enabling discoverability and verifiability of real world assets in supply chains.

## What is a knowledge graph?

There are many definitions of knowledge graphs (KGs), all slightly different. Without emphasizing on precision, all of them explain knowledge graphs as networks of entities — physical & digital objects, events or concepts and relationships between them.

## The knowledge graphs’ key characteristics

- Focus on data connections as "first class citizens" (linked data)
- Designed to ingest data from multiple sources, usually in different formats
- Flexible data models, easily extendable

## How Knowledge Graphs are used today

Today’s common knowledge graphs are deployed within the domain of one organization and are designed to capture data from various sources. KGs are used in Web2 by companies such as Amazon, Google, Uber, IBM and others for various applications - search, data integration, knowledge reasoning, recommendation engines, analytics, machine learning and AI etc. This generates enormous value and makes these organizations the biggest in the Web2 space.
